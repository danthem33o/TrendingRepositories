# Overview

All tests have a file name format of `<name>.spec.ts`.

# Running tests

Tests can be ran with either of the two commands:

- `e2e`
- `e2e:open`

`e2e` will run cypress in headless mode. This will run all of the tests without using the browser.

`e2e:open` will run cypress in headed mode. This will run the tests in the browser.
